# truth-about-cancer-crawler #

This is just a script to auto generate referred "friends" for the truth about cancer documentary prizes that are available until the 15th of april of 2016. I notices they do not validate emails so I took advantage of this and created a crawler that generates random emails and registers them via your referral url
You can get a referral link and view the prices by registering with your first name and email here:
